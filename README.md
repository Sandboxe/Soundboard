# My Expo App

This is a mobile app built using **Expo**. Follow the instructions below to view the app on your device using Expo Go.

## How to View the App on Your Device

### Prerequisites:
1. **Install Expo Go** on your mobile device:
   - **iOS**: Download from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779)
   - **Android**: Download from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)

2. **Clone this repository**:
   - Clone the project to your local machine using Git:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Sandboxe/Soundboard
     cd Soundboard
     ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   - Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

4. **Start Expo**:
   - Run Expo to start the development server:
     ```bash
     npx expo start
     ```
   - A **QR code** will be displayed in the terminal or browser.

### Viewing the App:
Once the app is running, you can view it by scanning the **QR code** found in the terminal. I couldn't be bothered to setup a permanent link/login to expo. 

### Troubleshooting:
- If the QR code doesn’t scan, make sure your device and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network.
- If you have trouble opening the app, ensure that **Expo Go** is installed and updated to the latest version on your device.
